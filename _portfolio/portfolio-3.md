This [report](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/the-dance-of-atoms.pdf) is a not-so-short compilation of the theoretical stuff I've covered till now for my ongoing UG RnD project under the guidance of Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan, head of [CNQT group](https://cnqt-group.org/) at IIT Bombay. All of the stuff written in the document has been patched together, *verbatim*, from multiple sources that I found to be highly instructive and I do not claim any original contribution to the same.
