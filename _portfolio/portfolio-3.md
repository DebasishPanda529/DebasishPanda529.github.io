This [report](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/the-dance-of-atoms.pdf) is a not-so-short compilation of the theoretical stuff I've covered 
till now for my ongoing UG RnD project under the guidance of Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan, head of [CNQT group](https://cnqt-group.org/) at IIT Bombay. 
Most of the theoretical stuff covered in the document has been patched together, *verbatim*, from multiple sources that I found to be highly instructive 
and I do not claim any original contribution to the same. 

This [article](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/qt-review-paper.pdf) is a brief review of ac-NEGF and Floquet-NEGF techniques, compiled as 
a part of the course project for EE755 (Quantum Transport in Nanoscale Devices). NEGF formalism in the presence of time-dependent fields is far 
more detailed (and beautifully so), and this short report hardly does justice to it, particularly since I missed out on the Floquet-NEGF portion, 
which definitely deserved more attention.
