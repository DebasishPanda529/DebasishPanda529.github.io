This [report](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/the-dance-of-atoms.pdf) is a not-so-short compilation of the theoretical stuff I've covered till now for my ongoing UG RnD project under the guidance of Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan, head of [CNQT group](https://cnqt-group.org/) at IIT Bombay. Most of the theoretical stuff covered in the document has been patched together, *verbatim*, from multiple sources that I found to be highly instructive and I do not claim any original contribution to the same.

This [article](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/qt-review-paper.pdf) is a brief review of ac-NEGF and Floquet-NEGF techniques, compiled as a part of the course project for EE755 (Quantum Transport in Nanoscale Devices).
