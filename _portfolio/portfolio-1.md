[These](https://DebasishPanda529.github.io/pdfs/applied-solid-state-physics.pdf) are the notes I made for the course of PH569 offered in the '23 Autumn semester by Prof. Suddhasatta Mahapatra. Would strongly recommend to complete PH418 (Intro To Condensed Matter Physics) before taking up this slightly more advanced course.
