_Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky_, \
_Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone_, \
_Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die_, \
_One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne_ \
_In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie_. \
_One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them_, \
_One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them_. \
_In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie_.

Though the finer details of LOTR lore have faded out of my memory over the years, it still remains one of the greatest novel series I've ever read - perhaps, it is _the_ fantasy series which started it all, because it laid down the foundation for nearly the entirety of modern fantasy franchises.
