Hello! I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I'm enrolled under the Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) programme offered by the university and am pursuing my specialisation in Solid State Devices (SSD) stream.

I have a wide range of academic interests, which include the physics of semiconductor devices, condensed matter physics, and all things quantum. In particular, I've recently developed an interest in the nascent yet fast-evolving field of quantum transport, which involves the application of the principles of quantum mechanics to nanoscale devices. With this, I've also begun my baby steps into the field of academic research (which was long due by now).

Apart from my academics, I indulge in all the vices of your average teenager- music, movies, and games. I'm a movie aficionado and love watching movies from diverse genres such as fantasy, history, Western, sci-fi, war, horror, and thrillers. Well, there's another genre, too, that of *Tarantino*, because, man, oh man, his movies are unlike anything you've ever watched. In my spare time, I make good use of my gaming laptop by putting it to exercise. I also love reading books, which encompass very much the same genres as the movies do. Apart from books, quizzing is one of the few literary arts that I indulge in.
