14 2200Z MAY 28: Taiwanese President Hai Long assumes complete control over the erstwhile Legislative Yuan and formally crowns himself as Emperor Chiang Kai-Shek II with unanimous support from the revanchist elements of the majority Chinese Nationalist Party in the Yuan.

20 1145Z JUL 28: The Emperor declares the national policy of reclaiming the lost glory of the Republic of China, and announces the Taiwanese breakthrough in manufacturing intermediate-range thermonuclear devices in association with the JSDF and ROKAF, independent of QUAD and/or NATO influence.

01 1435Z JAN 29: In a display of extraordinary courage, Taiwanese KF-21s intercept a squadron of PLAAF J-35s on international waters over South China Sea, sparking an immediate flurry of artillery and thermobaric MLRS exchange across the volatile maritime borders of Kinmen islands later in the day.

23 2400Z MAR 29: In a decisive geopolitical move, POTUS Bernie Sanders and Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi release a joint statement on behalf of QUAD member states vowing complete and unconditional QUAD military, logistics and intelligence support to the Taiwanese in event of a military struggle with the PRC mainland, irrespective of its aggressor.

15 1020Z DEC 29: In a horrifically dramatic turn of events, a PLAAF Xian Y-20 flying from Beijing to Jakarta with two four-star PLA generals is downed by Taiwanese Patriot missile batteries over international waters, without any prior warning as per Beijing's scathing press release.

18 2300Z DEC 30: Supreme Leader Xi Jinping vows complete and utter destruction of Taiwan, refusing to acknowledge the ROC's claims that the Taiwan Strait incident was not an act of provocation, but a result of mistaken but strategic action taken in view of Communist Chinese aggression. In the meanwhile, NATO reconnaissance satellites report observing significant deployment of PLAAF units, including armored brigades and Airborne units all across the Eastern coastline of the PRC.

02 1930Z JAN 31: Flying under the cover of darkness and undetected by highly accurate NATO-standard aerial surveillance radars, prototype sixth-gen PLAAF stealth bombers escorted by J-35s deploy multiple tactical EMP packages on major military and civilian infrastructure targets across Taiwan, resulting in a complete power and comms blackout throughout the island. This also results in a severance of comms with friendly QUAD forces, leading to the assumption that a Chinese invasion of the island is imminent, despite serious diplomatic attempts to discourage such a move by blatantly overt threats of sanctions and military action (nuclear or otherwise) against the PRC.

03 2130Z JAN 31: Within a span of mere 20 hours, 8 combined-arms brigades of PLANMC secure a major beachhead in the Changhua County after taking murderous losses which would have made "the Normandy landings look like a children's playground in comparison" as per an American Major attached with the Taiwanese units defending the beaches. The PLAAF's aerial superiority proves to be the pivotal factor in this battle since virtually all of Taiwanese anti-ship and SAM batteries are destroyed in pre-emptive tactical strikes throughout the island. 

04 1125Z JAN 31: ROC Armed Forces and supporting QUAD units are in full retreat all across western Taiwan to take up defensive positions in the urban environment, while QUAD scrambles its Navy and Airforce elements to slow down the vicious PLA onslaught across the island as more and more PLA divisions keep puring in through the expanding beachhead.
