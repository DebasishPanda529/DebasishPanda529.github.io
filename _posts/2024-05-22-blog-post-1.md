The relationship between religious authorities and science has never been a warm one through the ages- it took the Catholic Church 359 years to admit its wrongdoing against Galileo, and it's interesting to note that this was issued only after the moon landings and operational success of the Hubble Space Telescope (seems like the Church needed some conclusive evidence, eh?). In a similar vein, Darwin's (r)evolutionary theory wasn't taken too kindly by representatives of the Church because the idea of our forefathers being some tree-hugging primates from Africa seemed a bit too unpalatable as compared to the Biblical story of us being descendants of Adam and Eve, having been forged in God's own image. Now, in order not to appear as if I'm targeting a specific institution here, a more recent example would be the shutting down of universities and research centres in areas that were a part of the Daesh's short-lived 'Caliphate', or the Taliban's crackdown on subjects deemed to be not in accordance with the sharia law. In the eyes of a religious fanatic, those who have selflessly devoted their life to the sciences and to unravelling the infinite mysteries of the cosmos are minions of Satan, the *demons* which their revered scriptures warned them of, in material flesh. While this ideological conflict has more or less simmered out in the modern era, terrible things have been committed nonetheless under the guise of religion. That being said, has not science helped us perfect the art of war and mass destruction? An entire generation has lived through an era where the world tittered on the verge of being reduced to a barren, radioactive wasteland in a nuclear fire that threatened to cleanse friend and foe alike of their worldly sins. And yet, this very nuclear energy holds the key to a greener Earth, with the promise of powering this ever-expanding, energy-hungry civilisation of ours for millennia to come. Another example of such a cruel twist of fate is the story of the German chemist Fritz Haber-  the man who killed millions but fed billions. Almost a third of annual global food production is sustained by ammonia produced by the Haber-Bosch process, which revolutionized the mass production of fertilizers. And yet, Haber was directly responsible for developing and weaponising chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas as agents of chemical warfare during World War I, which earned him the grim title of the 'father of chemical warfare'. Even scientific adventures need to be bound by certain moral principles, so as not to devolve into a soulless creature devoid of human emotion. But then, the age-old question arises yet again: what is the extent of this moral bound? What role does religion have to play in this game of cat and mouse? Can science and religion coexist? 


Nothing sums up the fundamental distinction between science and religion better than this quote by Max Planck:

<p style="text-align: center;">
    Both religion and natural science require a belief in God for their activities, to the former He is the starting point, and to the latter the goal of every thought process. To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view.

Well, first of all, the humble reader might be wondering what right does a student in his early twenties who is still confused about career choices in life and tends to fall asleep during lectures have to philosophize on such a subtle issue that has eluded scientists and philosophers alike for centuries.
